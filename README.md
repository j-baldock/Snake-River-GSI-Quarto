# Snake River GSI

This book provides a visual story of the Upper Snake River Genetic Stock Identification Project. Our goals are to (1) assess the degree to which tributary contributions to the Snake River population of Yellowstone cutthroat trout vary across space and time, (2) quantify the effect of tributary characteristics (distance to the mainstem, catchment size, and groundwater availability) on proportional contributions to the mainstem, and (3) evaluate the extent to which tributary characteristics are associated with carry-over effects on growth and how carry-over effects vary across life stages.
